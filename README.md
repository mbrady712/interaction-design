# interaction-design
When I finished my Interaction Design course at ACC, the students had to create a directory with links to all of the completed exercises. The exercises 
showcase a range of different CSS and JavaScript effects, like keyframe animations, CSS transitions, and jQuery animations. To make the directory more 
aesthetically appealing, I used SASS to create a twinkling stars background. Random numbers were used for the stars' placement and their twinkling rates.
